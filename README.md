The project aims towards creating a web application which can be used by the people stuck in flooded areas.
The basic idea has been drawn after analysing the problems faced by the victims and the rescue team during the recent floods in Kerala.
-> The website acts as an interface between the victims and the rescue team.
-> We require from users to update the places which are accessible and safe to be rescued and which are not.
-> As locals or victims are more used to the places around the affected area, they need to mark the places which they think can be used to keep them safe and also indicate rescuers about the places where they can save people as many as possible.
-> Rescuers and victims collectively can mark places that are no longer accessible.
-> Rescuers will mark places where relief camps are placed.
-> Using the location of user a map is created which can be used to come up with a better rescue plan. Team of rescuers will be updated with people stuck and duty of each rescuer will be planned and updated based on the number of people stuck, distances, conditions, etc.

The project can be extended to show easier, safer and closer path to rescuers to reach victims and vice versa.
